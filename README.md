Certainly, here's a reshaped version of the provided information with similar meaning but rephrased:

**#32bitsSingleCycleMIPS**

- The MIPS architecture adheres to the RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) design philosophy, striving to simplify complexity while optimizing performance. It employs a fixed 32-bit instruction length, facilitating easy instruction decoding and execution. This design focuses on a concise set of instructions, prioritizing simplicity over rarely used complex instructions.

- In MIPS architecture, memory is byte-addressed rather than word-addressed.

- Within the Single Cycle MIPS architecture, each instruction is executed in a solitary clock cycle. This entails completing the entire process of instruction fetching, decoding, execution, and write-back in just one cycle.

- MIPS architecture encompasses diverse instructions, including:

    1. `lw`: Load Word (`lw   rt, imm(rs)`).
    2. `sw`: Store Word (`sw   rt, imm(rs)`).
    3. `addi`: Add Immediate (`addi rt, rs, imm`).
    4. `beq`.
    5. `Jal` & `j`.
    6. R-type instructions: [add / sub / slt / mul].

- MIPS architecture utilizes three instruction formats:

    1. **R-Type**: Involving register operands.

    2. **J-Type**: Designed for jumping.

    3. **I-Type**: Incorporating immediate operands.

- MIPS architecture comprises a set of registers.

- Single Cycle MIPS can be divided into two fundamental components: Datapath and Control Unit.

    ![ControlUnit](https://github.com/MohamedDawod29/32bits-single-cycle-MIPs/assets/138527948/7ef8a17d-3a9a-485a-9611-093a27eb60b5)

    ![Datapath](https://github.com/MohamedDawod29/32bits-single-cycle-MIPs/assets/138527948/4dc86d59-3099-4d34-afc8-7d3fb0ace54e)

    Together, they form a complete single-cycle MIPS processor.
